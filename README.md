i am an 85 y/o programmer. i wrote my first program in 1960 to run on a Bendix-G15. It used 29 bit words and was a great learning tool.  
I was actually employed to maintain it, and 4 analog computers, and was often confronted by engineers saying that my machine was broken
because their program wouldn't run. So thats how i became a programmer. I have some mainframe experience but most of my work has been
programming chips, micros, and minis. I started with assemblers but, in the 70's, found 'C' and i was hooked. I later discovered 'C#' 
much preferrable to 'C++'. In 2020 I jhad a brain injury and now I am trying to keep my brain agile by writing a web app using html,
javascript, and PHP with mysql all on an 'xampp' backbone.  I have it working but I want to substitute 'node,js' for PHP. I need help 
to get started. Do I start my 'myapp.html' and use the node.js api? What is the procedure for getting it to go? where is the api?
